        <p>French omelette is a quick dish that takes just a little bit of practice to make. <br>This recipe takes about <strong>10 min</strong> and serves <strong>1</strong> person.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>30g butter</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon of salt</li>

            <li>Whisk the eggs, salt and <strong>half a teaspoon</strong> of water in a bowl. Whisk until the mixture feels really liquid and the whites are completely blended in.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a skillet on a <strong>medium</strong> heat. Just as the butter is melted and before it starts to drizzle, <br>pour in the eggs and start stiring in a circular pattern with a spatula. Be sure to lift the skillet every few seconds and shake it, while continuously <br>stiring the eggs. Continue doing so until shaking the skillet doesn't level the eggs anymore.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with a bit of pepper if you wish</li>
            <li>Using the spatula, move the runny eggs around so the mixutre has an even thickness. Remove from heat once the surface isn't runny anymore </li>
            <li>Start rolling the eggs into a cylinder, until you get to about 5cm from the opposing edge. Use the spatula to fold the flap over the cylinder. <br>Slide the omelette onto the plate</li>
